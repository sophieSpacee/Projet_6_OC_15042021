# Piiquante -  Projet 6 of Web Developper course with OpenClassrooms


## Project Goals 

This project is part of my course to become a full stack developer. It was my first backend project. I learned how to use NodeJS, Express and MongoDB to develop it. 
The goal was to create a secure API for an existing frontend interface. 

##To start this project 

1- First, you need to execute the frontend application :

Clone this repository : 
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/dwj-projet6.git

Execute npm install 
Execute npm install node-sass@4.14.1
Execute npm start 

You can access and use the application at this address:
 http://localhost:4200

2- Then, you need to execute the API :

Clone this repository :
https://github.com/sophieSpacee/SophieGauthier_6_15042021.git

Execute npm install
Execute nodemon
The API is launched at: http://localhost:3000

Open  http://localhost:4200 to use the application
